backstory: >
Jacqueline is a private detective in Las Vegas. No casino has ever beaten her, bullets always miss her at the last second, and even her lottery tickets tend to hit the jackpot. 
People say she was born lucky, but she knows the truth—her success isn’t luck, but rather a result of her razor-sharp observation and psychological prowess, 
allowing her to read her opponents in an instant. While her case-solving methods appear casual and improvised, every seemingly “coincidental” victory is backed by meticulous calculations.
