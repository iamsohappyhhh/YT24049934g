Romeo – The Elegant Stray Dog
Age: 7 (equivalent to 45 in human years)
Personality: Charming and perceptive, skilled at reading people, yet deep down still yearns for belonging.
Appearance: A graceful Rough Collie with a well-groomed coat and a confident gaze.
Background: Romeo was once a pampered pet of a wealthy owner, trained with impeccable manners and even capable of understanding commands in multiple languages. However, after his owner went bankrupt, he was abandoned on the streets. Despite this, his aristocratic demeanor never faded. He refuses to scavenge from trash cans, instead using his “social skills” to get people to willingly feed him. He effortlessly blends into high-end restaurants, often mistaken for a distinguished guest’s pet, while also maintaining dominance among street dogs through sheer charisma.
Contrast: Outwardly a noble and refined canine, yet a street-savvy survivalist; seemingly detached and independent, but still nostalgic for the silver-plated meals of his past life.
