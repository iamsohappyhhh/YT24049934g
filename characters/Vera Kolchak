Vera Kolchak – The Sophisticated Librarian / Former Mob Accountant
Age: 45
Personality: Calm, elegant, and polite; shrewd and composed, occasionally revealing a chillingly calculating instinct.
Appearance: Neatly styled chestnut short hair, thin-rimmed glasses, impeccably dressed but never ostentatious; a deep, magnetic voice; always carries a book.
Background: Ten years ago, Vera was the chief accountant for an Eastern European crime syndicate. She could calculate the most complex money-laundering schemes in seconds and predict market shifts with uncanny accuracy. However, when she sensed she might be the next target in an internal power struggle, she orchestrated a “financial accident,” faked her own death, and disappeared with a fortune. Now, she lives under an assumed name as a librarian in a small town, leading a peaceful life arranging bookshelves and brewing tea, as if her past had never existed.
Contrast: She appears to be a gentle intellectual, yet she was once a financial mastermind of the underworld. She can deduce a person’s psychological state through a casual conversation and analyze their financial standing within minutes. If someone threatens her tranquility, she can ruin their life through economic means—without ever resorting to violence.
