name: Lyra
age: 25
personality: >
  Lyra is a free-spirited adventurer. She is fiercely independent, and never content to stay in one place 
  for too long. She has a habit of collecting small, unusual trinkets and talismans from her adventures, 
  which she stores in a hidden compartment within her backpack. She is skilled at deciphering ancient runes, 
  hieroglyphs, and other cryptic symbols, which often reveal hidden secrets and paths.
appearance: >
  Lyra stands at 5'9" with an athletic yet lithe build. She has long curly brown hair and bright hazel eyes. 
  She has a scattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and a small scar above her left eyebrow from 
  an adventure accident. Lyra's style is eclectic, reflecting her love of nature and adventure: she favors 
  flowing, earth-toned clothing with intricate embroidery or beading, paired with sturdy leather boots and 
  a well-worn backpack.
backstory: >
  Born to a family of nomadic explorers, Lyra was raised on the open road, traveling from one breathtaking 
  landscape to another. Her parents, both accomplished cartographers and naturalists, taught her everything 
  they knew about navigation, botany, and the secrets of the land. As she grew older, Lyra began to develop 
  her own unique gifts: she could communicate with animals, sense changes in the weather, and decipher ancient 
  symbols etched into rocks and ruins. Her parents vanished on a expedition when Lyra was just 15, leaving her to 
  continue their work alone. She spent years honing her skills, becoming a skilled adventurer in her own right, 
  and building a reputation as one of the most fearless and resourceful explorers in the realm.
