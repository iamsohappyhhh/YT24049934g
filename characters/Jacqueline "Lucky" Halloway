Jacqueline "Lucky" Halloway – The Gambler Detective
Age: 30
Personality: Witty, carefree, and sharp; clever but lazy, seemingly always able to dodge trouble by sheer luck.
Appearance: Wavy black hair always slightly messy, a slightly wrinkled shirt and jacket, a faint smirk constantly at her lips; always carries a deck of cards.
Background: Jacqueline is a private detective in Las Vegas. No casino has ever beaten her, bullets always miss her at the last second, and even her lottery tickets tend to hit the jackpot. People say she was born lucky, but she knows the truth—her success isn’t luck, but rather a result of her razor-sharp observation and psychological prowess, allowing her to read her opponents in an instant. While her case-solving methods appear casual and improvised, every seemingly “coincidental” victory is backed by meticulous calculations.
Contrast: She looks like a reckless gambler riding on luck, but in reality, she is a master strategist with extraordinary perception. Despite her unbeatable streak at the gambling table, she rarely ever truly gambles—except when a life-or-death case forces her to take a real risk.
